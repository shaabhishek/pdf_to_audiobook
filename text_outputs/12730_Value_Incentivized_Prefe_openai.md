Introduction and Motivation  
In our work we address a critical challenge in training large language models using reinforcement learning from human feedback. Traditionally, reinforcement learning from human feedback—often abbreviated as RLHF—uses methods that first model human preferences as rewards and then fine‐tune large language models by reinforcing outputs that are more preferred. Although successful pipelines such as InstructGPT and recent direct methods like direct preference optimization have simplified some aspects, a central difficulty remains: how to incorporate uncertainty estimation effectively when learning reward models from preference data. 

The broad motivation arises from the fact that while uncertainty estimates guide exploration in classical online reinforcement learning, applying these principles to the RLHF context is challenging. In our setting the reward model is defined only up to an additive shift—as dictated by the well‐known Bradley–Terry model for pairwise comparisons—and explicit estimation of confidence intervals for large neural network parameters becomes infeasible. [pause]

To overcome these limitations, we propose a unified algorithmic framework called Value‐Incentivized Preference Optimization, or VPO. In VPO, the maximum likelihood estimation of the reward function is augmented with a regularization term that is proportional to the maximum expected “value” obtainable under that reward. By choosing the sign of the regularization term appropriately, we simultaneously encourage optimism for online exploration and impose pessimism in offline settings. This implicit regularization avoids the complex task of explicitly estimating uncertainty while preserving theoretical and practical benefits. [pause]

Related Work  
Our research builds on a rich literature in two key areas. On one hand, there is RLHF, where prior methods have attempted both decoupled reward modeling and policy optimization, as well as recent work on direct preference optimization that reparameterizes the policy directly from pairwise data. However, many of these methods neglect uncertainty or simply do not include an exploration-exploitation balance, partly due to the difficulties involved with uncertainty estimation using large language models. 

On the other hand, there is a well-established tradition in reinforcement learning that uses confidence-bound techniques to implement optimism for exploration in online RL and pessimism for offline RL settings. Unfortunately, the typical techniques for constructing confidence intervals do not scale when policies are parameterized by large deep neural networks. Our VPO framework unifies these seemingly disparate approaches by implicitly incorporating a value-based bias that reflects uncertainty without needing explicit error quantification. [pause]

Methodology and Theoretical Framework  
In our methodology we start from the standard RLHF pipeline. First, human annotators provide pairwise preference data that is modeled using the Bradley–Terry formulation. Under this model, the probability that one answer is favored over another is given by the logistic function applied to the difference in their “reward” values. In our setting, the reward function is only defined up to a prompt-dependent global shift. To remedy this, we select a calibration distribution—referred to as π_cal—to fix the zero level. This calibration both eliminates the shift ambiguity and introduces a useful form of regularization.

Let me now describe the core idea behind our value-based regularization. We define the quantity J-star, denoted as J*(r). Conceptually, this represents the maximum expected return under the reward model r—essentially the “value” if one follows the optimal policy relative to r. In our VPO framework, we add a regularization term that scales with J*(r) to the usual negative log-likelihood objective for reward estimation. When this term is added with a positive sign, as is appropriate for online learning, it encourages the reward estimator to be optimistic and thereby promote exploration. Conversely, when a negative sign is used in offline learning, the method discourages over-optimistic reward estimates and enforces a type of conservatism.

Mathematically speaking, while our paper contains many detailed equations, I will summarize the essence in words. For example, one classical equation we build on is the Bradley–Terry model which, in its standard form, states that the probability of one answer y₁ being preferred over another answer y₂ for a given prompt x is given by the logistic function applied to the difference between r(x, y₁) and r(x, y₂). Instead of merely maximizing the likelihood of the observed pairwise comparisons with respect to the reward model r, we propose optimizing an objective that subtracts or adds (depending on the setting) a term proportional to J*(r). This term is “value incentivized” because it encourages the reward to tilt towards regions where the resulting value function is high, thus incorporating a notion of uncertainty indirectly without computing explicit confidence bounds.

To complete the formulation, we leverage a result known as the closed-form solution for the optimal policy in KL-regularized reinforcement learning. In that framework, the optimal policy is proportional to the product of a prior policy and the exponential of the reward scaled by a temperature parameter β. Furthermore, through algebraic manipulation we show that the reward function can be written in terms of the logarithms of the policy distributions. In the resulting VPO objective, one finds both a standard term analogous to what is used in direct preference optimization—and an added “value incentivized” term that can be interpreted as a regularization pushing the current policy to favor (or avoid) specific behaviors relative to a reference or calibration policy. [pause]

We present two instantiations of the VPO framework. The first is an online method in which the training data grows over time as the current policy interacts with the environment, collects new queries, and receives new pairwise comparisons. In each iteration of online VPO, we generate new preference data, update the reward model via regularized maximum likelihood, and then update the policy by maximizing a KL-regularized value function. Our theoretical analysis under a linear reward model—where the reward is approximated as an inner product between a feature vector and a parameter vector—reveals that our algorithm achieves cumulative regret on the order of the square root of the number of iterations, matching the optimal rates seen in standard contextual bandit problems.

The second instantiation is an offline version. In offline VPO, all the preference data has been collected ahead of time, so we perform one-pass reward estimation and then policy optimization with the appropriately adjusted regularization term. The main challenge in offline settings is to mitigate over-optimization, and our pessimistic variant addresses this by effectively penalizing rewards that would otherwise lead to overly confident policies. The regret analysis in the offline case demonstrates a performance gap that also falls at the well-known rate of one over the square root of the dataset size, reflecting the familiar trade-offs in offline reinforcement learning.

Figures, Tables, and Visual Insights  
Throughout our paper we include several figures and tables to provide empirical support for our claims. For instance, one key figure shows the accuracy curves across training iterations for different language models. The figure compares our VPO method with baseline methods called direct preference optimization and an alternative method known as identity preference optimization. The plot clearly demonstrates that VPO maintains high accuracy throughout training and avoids the over-optimization problem that is sometimes evident in the baseline methods.

Another set of figures illustrates experimental results from our online studies. These figures report performance metrics such as win rates against a supervised fine-tuning baseline. In one experiment, for example, the win rate of VPO in the online setting is shown to oscillate slightly early in training, but as training progresses and with appropriate tuning of the exploration coefficient—denoted by the Greek letter alpha—the win rates rapidly surpass those of the baseline methods. We have also included tables summarizing evaluation metrics on standard benchmarks such as ARC-Challenge, AlpacaEval, and MT-Bench. In one table, you will notice that our iterative VPO method not only improves the win rate considerably over the baseline that was only fine-tuned with supervised learning, but also compares remarkably well to larger, more expensive models—even with a relatively small base model.

Experimental Results  
Turning now to our experimental results, our study is organized into offline and online settings. In the offline experiments we focus on a multiple-choice question answering task known as ARC-Challenge. We work with several language models, including versions of LLAMA 2 and FLAN-T5, and compare VPO with DPO and IPO baselines. The key insight is that while the direct policy optimization method starts to over-optimize with extended training—leading to performance degradation—our VPO method remains stable and consistently achieves higher accuracy. These results are highlighted by figures that track accuracy versus training steps for each model.

In the online setting, we carried out two separate experiments. The first employed a buffered online approach, where new preference data is gathered interactively and stored in a buffer for subsequent exploration. Using a summarization task, we compare our optimistic VPO variant against an online DPO baseline. Although the win rate of VPO shows some oscillation initially, careful tuning of the exploration coefficient leads to overall superior performance. The second online experiment adopted an iterative training framework. Here, we used an external dataset of preference pairs and performed multiple iterations of training. This iterative process not only yielded steady improvements over baseline methods but also demonstrated that VPO can eventually achieve win rates competitive with, or even surpassing, those seen in significantly larger language models. [pause]

In addition to these primary experiments, we conducted tests on synthetic bandit and linear contextual bandit problems to isolate key algorithmic properties. The multi-armed bandit experiments—where there is only one prompt and a limited set of arms representing possible answers—show that an appropriately tuned VPO method outperforms a maximum likelihood baseline in terms of cumulative regret. Similarly, the linear contextual bandit experiments, which simulate more realistic structured environments with continuous features, confirm that VPO yields a lower sub-optimality gap as the quantity of data increases. These experiments solidly reinforce our theoretical analyses and highlight the central role of the value-driven regularization in balancing exploration and exploitation. [pause]

Conclusion and Discussion  
To summarize, our work introduces Value‐Incentivized Preference Optimization, a unified framework that effectively incorporates the principles of optimism and pessimism into reward modeling for reinforcement learning from human feedback. By re-formulating the maximum likelihood estimation of the reward function with an added bias term based on the value function, our approach overcomes the challenges posed by explicit uncertainty estimation in large language models.

We developed rigorous theoretical guarantees, showing that both our online and offline VPO variants achieve regret bounds and performance rates comparable to those found in conventional reinforcement learning. Our extensive experimental validations—in tasks such as text summarization, dialogue tasks, and standard benchmarks—demonstrate that VPO consistently outperforms established baselines while remaining robust to over-optimization.

Looking ahead, we believe that future research can focus on adaptive methods for choosing the exploration coefficient, as well as refining the calibration distribution choice. Moreover, the principles underlying VPO may extend to broader reinforcement learning setups beyond RLHF, ultimately enabling robust, uncertainty-aware learning in a wide range of deep learning applications.

Thank you for listening to this summary of our research on VPO. We hope this approach offers new insights into how uncertainty can be integrated implicitly into reinforcement learning pipelines for alignment and beyond, paving the way for more stable and effective learning algorithms in large-scale language model training.

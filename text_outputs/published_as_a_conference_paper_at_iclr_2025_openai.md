Title and Authors  
This paper is titled “MR.Q: Model-Based Representations for Q-Learning.” Our team of researchers developed this work, and while we do not list institutional affiliations here, the authors collaborated to advance a general-purpose approach to deep reinforcement learning. [pause]

Introduction and Motivation  
In our research, we set out to address a long-standing challenge in reinforcement learning. Many existing algorithms are highly specialized and tightly tuned to particular environments. This specialization limits their broad applicability and makes it difficult for practitioners to build truly general-purpose systems. We wished to develop an algorithm that remains robust across varied domains without requiring extensive re-tuning. Our approach, MR.Q, integrates ideas from both model‐based and model‐free reinforcement learning. The core idea is to learn predictive representations of state and action pairs that capture the underlying dynamics and reward structure of a given Markov Decision Process. These learned embeddings aim to approximate a linear relationship with the true value function, even though we eventually use a non-linear function for value estimation. In other words, by first mapping raw inputs into an invariant, abstract space, MR.Q allows for a standardized set of hyperparameters to work across very different tasks. [pause]

Related Work and Background  
Historically, reinforcement learning methods have been divided into two camps. On one side, model‐based methods explicitly learn a model of the environment’s dynamics to facilitate planning. On the other, model‐free methods sidestep the need for a dynamics model and directly optimize the policy or value function. Our work builds on recent insights that suggest the benefits of model‐based learning can be largely attributed to the ability to derive rich state representations. Past research has explored both model‐free approaches like Q-learning, as well as policy gradient methods, and even evolutionary strategies for learning decision policies. Despite these successes, many of these methods still lack the flexibility needed to perform well across a wide range of benchmarks without significant reconfiguration. We also stand on the shoulders of research into dynamics-based representation learning, which has utilized ideas such as successor features and bisimulation metrics to drive more efficient learning in complex environments. Essentially, we want to capture the essence of the environment’s dynamics in our representations, so that learning the value function becomes more efficient and robust. [pause]

Methodology and the MR.Q Algorithm  
At the heart of our proposed method is the MR.Q algorithm – short for Model-Based Representations for Q-Learning. Let me explain the approach in several parts.

First, we define a state encoder function and a state-action encoder function. The state encoder, denoted as f, transforms raw observations into a compact, abstract state embedding. Meanwhile, the state-action encoder, which we call g, combines the state embedding with the chosen action to form a joint representation. These functions offer two primary benefits. They allow us to produce a unified embedding that filters out irrelevant details from images or vector observations, and they establish a base upon which the true value function, Q, can be approximated.

The theoretical motivation comes from considering the value function as a function that can be “linearly” decomposed over these learned features. Although we do not restrict ourselves solely to a linear combination, we encourage the embedding to approximate such a relationship. In our presentation, an important equation expresses that for a given state and action pair, the value Q(s, a) is approximately equal to the dot product of the learned feature vector and a corresponding weight vector. While the full equation involves expectations over trajectories as well as the dynamics and rewards predicted by the model, the key message is that the learned features are intended to linearly capture the underlying value. [pause]

To realize this goal in practice, we design a loss function that combines multiple terms. One term measures the error in predicting the immediate reward, another assesses the error in predicting the next state embedding, and a third term predicts terminal signals. We also incorporate a hyperparameter to balance the influence of the dynamics loss relative to the reward loss. Importantly, the dynamics target is generated using a “target network”. This target network updates periodically and helps decouple the state-action encoding from the current policy, reducing non-stationarity. In simple words, while our method is rooted in the idea of a linear relationship between features and value, we ultimately use a non-linear approximator – a neural network – to compute the actual value estimates, thus mitigating the inevitable approximation errors. [pause]

An additional aspect of our methodology involves standard reinforcement learning update rules. For value function updates, we build upon ideas from twin delayed deep deterministic policy gradients, typically abbreviated as TD3. In practice, our algorithm computes multi-step returns, uses a Huber loss to dampen the effect of outliers, and adjusts the reward scale based on recent observations. The policy, meanwhile, is updated using deterministic policy gradient methods. To ensure robustness and consistency across varied environments, we apply the same architecture to both continuous and discrete action spaces. For discrete settings, a Gumbel-softmax function is employed to yield a differentiable approximation of the discrete policy. [pause]

Let me briefly mention our theoretical results. We provide formal theorems that demonstrate under idealized conditions the equivalence between a model-free semi-gradient temporal difference update and a model-based rollout using our learned dynamics and reward predictors. One theorem states that if specific relationships hold among the predictions, then there exists a non-linear function that recovers the true value function from the learned state-action embeddings. For our audience, it is sufficient to know that these formal insights justified our design choices and motivated the loss functions that we use in MR.Q. [pause]

Experiments and Key Results  
To evaluate MR.Q, we ran experiments across four major reinforcement learning benchmarks:

1. Gym – Locomotion: This set of tasks involves continuous control environments using the MuJoCo simulator. In these experiments, we compared MR.Q with state-of-the-art methods, including TD7, TD-MPC2, DreamerV3, and policy optimization methods like Proximal Policy Optimization. Our results indicated that while some specialized methods performed well on a single task, MR.Q achieved competitive performance across all five locomotion tasks by using the same hyperparameter settings.

2. DeepMind Control Suite – Proprioceptive Signal: Here, instead of pixel-based observations, the agents receive vector observations that describe proprioceptive states. MR.Q again demonstrated robust results compared to prominent baselines. Notably, our design reasons that the learned representation allows for sample-efficient performance and generalizes better across tasks such as acrobot swing-up, cartpole balancing, and quadruped walking.

3. DeepMind Control Suite – Visual Input: In this setting, agents are tasked with controlling robots using raw image inputs rather than vectors. Although techniques like DrQ-v2 have been highly competitive, MR.Q maintained strong performance, particularly in environments where capturing the underlying dynamics is more challenging. The loss functions based on categorical reward representations and the unrolling of the learned model over short horizons proved crucial in these configurations.

4. Atari Games: This classic benchmark, which features discrete action spaces and pixel observations, was used to test the algorithm’s generality further. Although in some games the model-based approach DreamerV3 achieved higher scores, MR.Q consistently improved over standard model-free baselines like DQN, Rainbow, and Proximal Policy Optimization. Our normalized scores, which are presented against human performance baselines, showed that MR.Q can handle the intricacies of different observation spaces using a single algorithmic framework.

Accompanying our numerical results are several figures and tables. For example, one figure shows aggregate learning curves across all benchmarks, with the shaded areas indicating 95 percent confidence intervals. Another table summarizes our design study. In this experiment, we intentionally varied certain components of the algorithm—such as replacing the non-linear value function with a strict linear combination or substituting the state-action dynamics target with a state-only target. The outcomes highlighted that maintaining an approximately linear relation between embeddings and values was more beneficial than simply increasing model capacity. These visual elements underline that MR.Q balances theory with pragmatic design choices to achieve robust performance across diverse tasks. [pause]

Discussion and Conclusion  
In our discussion, we emphasize that MR.Q bridges the gap between model-free and model-based reinforcement learning. By incorporating model-based objectives into a model-free training paradigm, we demonstrate that much of the benefit of planning and simulation can be reaped simply through a rich, carefully learned representation. This suggests that future improvements in reinforcement learning may well come from better understanding and designing representations rather than adding more complexity to the planning process.

We also observed an important insight in our experiments: there is little positive transfer between benchmarks. For instance, some methods that perform excellently on continuous control tasks with vector inputs do not generalize well to image-based Atari games. This reinforces the need for algorithms like MR.Q that are designed to handle varied input modalities and task dynamics without re-tuning individual hyperparameters.

Despite these promising results, our work is not without limitations. MR.Q, in its current form, does not address certain challenging problems, such as long-horizon hard exploration tasks or non-Markovian environments. Moreover, while our evaluation covered standard benchmarks in Gym, DeepMind Control, and Atari, it remains an open question how well MR.Q would perform in more exotic setups, such as multi-agent settings or tasks involving language understanding. Nonetheless, the simplicity and efficiency of MR.Q, along with its competitive performance, mark an important step toward general-purpose reinforcement learning.

In conclusion, our paper has presented MR.Q as a unifying framework that leverages model-based representation learning within a model-free training routine. By learning a state-action embedding that approximates a linear mapping to the value function, and then using a non-linear function to capture the residual complexities, MR.Q achieves robust and efficient performance across a diverse set of tasks. This work underscores the value of carefully designed representations and opens up new directions for developing accessible, high-performance reinforcement learning algorithms. [pause]

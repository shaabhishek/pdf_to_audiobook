Introduction

In this research, we address a central challenge in offline reinforcement learning – that is, how to learn a control policy using solely pre‑collected static datasets. Offline reinforcement learning, unlike its online counterpart, avoids the costly or even dangerous exploration in real-world applications such as robotics or industrial control. The key issue here is the distribution shift between the behavior policy that generated the dataset and the policy ultimately optimized by the algorithm. This mismatch can lead to errors in the value function when the policy suggests actions that were never or rarely seen in the dataset.

Our work is inspired by an experiment where training a discriminator with both the offline dataset and an additional expert dataset, and then performing weighted behavior cloning, produced remarkably strong results. This observation led us to view offline reinforcement learning from an imitation perspective. In essence, if we could compute the optimal weighting – in other words, the ideal discriminator weight – then even simple behavior cloning could outperform many classical and state‑of‑the‑art offline reinforcement learning methods.

The existing dual formulation of reinforcement learning – sometimes called Dual‑RL – uses the ratio between the optimized and behavior policy’s state‑action visitation distributions. However, we noticed two crucial issues with current Dual‑RL methods. First, when using the widely adopted semi‑gradient updates, these methods end up estimating an action-level distribution ratio rather than the correct state‑action visitation ratio. Second, even when the gradients are appropriately computed, the learned regularized optimal visitation distribution does not exactly match the true optimal ratio. These limitations prevent current Dual‑RL methods from achieving their full potential.

In our approach, called Iterative Dual‑RL, we propose a corrected procedure to gradually refine the dataset. By iteratively removing suboptimal transitions using the previously learned visitation ratio, we generate a sequence of progressively better training datasets. This self‑distillation process ultimately drives the learned ratio much closer to the optimal discriminator weight.

Preliminaries

Before diving into our methodology, let’s review some basic concepts. Our reinforcement learning problem is formulated as a Markov Decision Process. Recall that this process is defined by a tuple containing the state space, action space, the transition dynamics, the reward function, the initial state distribution, and the discount factor.

In offline reinforcement learning, we work with a fixed dataset. Within this context, we define key quantities like the value function, which represents the expected return from a state, and the state‑action value function, which looks at the return for taking an action in a given state. Moreover, we introduce the concept of the state‑action visitation distribution – a measure of how frequently a given state and action are encountered when following a particular policy.

A major idea in reinforcement learning is the dual formulation. In contrast to primal methods, which alternate between evaluating the value function and improving the policy, Dual‑RL reparameterizes the learning problem in terms of the visitation distribution. The optimal policy can then be implicitly recovered by correcting the mismatch between the learned and data distributions through weighting by the ratio of visitation distributions.

Methodology: Limitations and the IDRL Approach

The first part of our methodology examines the shortcomings in existing Dual‑RL techniques. Specifically, we show that the common semi‑gradient update – although useful for stabilizing training – actually leads to learning an action distribution ratio. This means that the ratio it estimates only compares the probability of an action under the optimized policy with that under the behavior policy, without taking into account whether the state is even “good” or visited frequently by an optimal policy. Furthermore, when certain transitions are assigned a zero weight, the dataset becomes fragmented, preventing effective learning of the value function.

To address this, we reframe the problem as one of off‑policy evaluation. In other words, instead of just comparing actions, we use an auxiliary objective to recover the true state‑action visitation distribution ratio. Using techniques from convex optimization and Fenchel‑Rockafellar duality, we derive an optimization problem whose solution yields a corrected weight. For many of you familiar with this theory, note that rather than reading every formula, the key takeaway is that our approach decomposes the challenging task of computing the optimal ratio into two complementary sub‑tasks. The first sub‑task estimates the action distribution ratio through semi‑gradient updates, and the second sub‑task corrects this estimate to reflect the complete state‑action visitation distribution. This correction is critical because it allows our method to effectively filter the dataset – allowing only transitions that are close to the expert, or optimal, visitation to be used for policy extraction.

We then build towards an iterative self‑distillation process. In each iteration, we update our estimate of the visitation ratio and use this estimate to trim the offline dataset. Transitions that do not reach a positive threshold are removed. The remaining subset of data then better reflects the “good” or near‑optimal states. In subsequent iterations, this process is repeated, and the dataset becomes progressively “cleaner.” Finally, at the last iteration, we use the learned, near‑optimal visitation distribution ratio as weights in a behavior cloning procedure to extract the final policy.

In summary, our algorithm first learns a preliminary action ratio, then corrects it to obtain a state‑action ratio, and finally iterates this process for further refinement. Throughout our presentation, we refer to important theoretical results – for example, propositions and theorems that guarantee the convergence and monotonic improvement of the refined data quality. One theorem demonstrates that the policy performance, measured by weighted behavior cloning, is lower‑bounded by a term that improves with every iteration. Another key result is that the refined dataset at each iteration guarantees a monotonic improvement in the performance proxy.

Illustrative Figures and Tables

Let me briefly describe some of the key visual elements in our work:

• Figure 1 in the paper presents a block‑diagram of the overall Iterative Dual‑RL framework. It shows how the offline dataset is first used to learn an initial discriminator via the dual formulation, and then how transitions are filtered based on learned weights before performing behavior cloning. The illustration emphasizes the “curriculum” nature of the approach, where the dataset support is refined iteration by iteration.

• Figure 2 demonstrates the approach in a grid‑world toy example. In this experiment, the original dataset is visualized along with the trajectories that emerge as iterative filtering is applied. Early iterations demonstrate filtering based on the uncorrected action ratio, while later iterations show the dramatic improvement when the full state‑action correction is applied. The grid‑world example highlights how IDRL is able to successfully identify the optimal path by gradually removing transitions that lead away from the goal.

• Table 1 reports normalized scores on several benchmark datasets – including Mujoco locomotion tasks, Antmaze navigation tasks, and Kitchen tasks. The table shows that Iterative Dual‑RL either matches or outperforms state‑of‑the‑art primal and dual methods. In particular, the improvements over methods that only apply a single iteration of behavior cloning or that use uncorrected ratios clearly demonstrate the benefit of our iterative refinement process.

• Additional tables in the experiments section provide ablation studies. These studies compare the performance when using only one iteration or when relying on the uncorrected action ratio for filtering. These comparisons affirm that both the iterative component and the correction to state‑action weighting are necessary to achieve optimal performance.

• Figures 4 and 5 depict learning curves on different datasets. They show the evolution of performance over training steps, reinforcing our claim that iterative refinement leads to more stable and robust policy learning.

Experimental Results

Our experiments span several challenging settings. First, we evaluated our method on the standard D4RL benchmark. This suite includes Mujoco locomotion tasks, where the state and action spaces are continuous, as well as Antmaze and Kitchen tasks that require stitching together different subtrajectories to achieve navigation or manipulation goals.

In these experiments, Iterative Dual‑RL was run for a small number of iterations – typically one or two – and even with such a limited number of iterations, our method achieves performance that is competitive with or surpasses that of both primal‑RL approaches, such as TD3‑plus‑BC and CQL, and dual‑RL approaches, including recent methods like O‑DICE.

Our ablation studies further reinforce the contribution of each component. When we compare a version of IDRL that uses only one iteration to the full iterative version with two iterations, we see clear improvements in the policy performance. Similarly, using uncorrected action ratios for filtering leads to significantly worse results, confirming that the correction to derive state‑action ratios is critical. Furthermore, we extend the experiments to settings with corrupted or heterogeneous demonstrations. In these settings – where a dataset contains only a small percentage of expert transitions mixed with a large amount of random transitions – the iterative process helps the algorithm filter out the poor data. As a result, even in very noisy environments, our method gradually isolates the high‐quality transitions, resulting in a near–optimal policy performance.

The improved performance and stability during training, as shown in our learning curves, emphasize the practical impact of breaking the regularization barrier that earlier methods struggle with.

Related Work

Our work builds on and differentiates itself from two broad families of approaches in offline reinforcement learning. On one hand, traditional primal methods – which alternate between policy evaluation and policy improvement – typically enforce a behavior constraint to mitigate the distribution shift. Such methods include TD3‑plus‑BC, conservative Q‑learning, and related techniques that incorporate value regularization or uncertainty estimation. However, these primal approaches may still produce out‑of‑distribution actions when the regularization is too loose or too strict.

On the other hand, Dual‑RL methods reframed the problem by directly working with the state‑action visitation distributions. The advantage is that it avoids querying value functions for out‑of‑distribution actions. Yet, as we have highlighted, existing Dual‑RL techniques often estimate an action distribution ratio – rather than the full visitation ratio – and may suffer from fragmentation issues.

In contrast, our Iterative Dual‑RL method combines the best of both worlds. It leverages the inherent advantage of in‑sample, dual formulations while correcting for the shortcomings of the semi‑gradient updates. Through iterative self‑distillation, the offline dataset is continuously refined, leading to a more accurate discriminator weighting for imitation learning. This connection between offline reinforcement learning and imitation learning is central to our work, and it is reinforced by recent studies that show a strong relationship between behavior cloning and offline policy optimization.

Conclusion and Future Directions

To summarize, our paper introduces Iterative Dual‑RL, a new approach designed to overcome limitations in current Dual‑RL methods. By establishing a corrected formulation for recovering the true state‑action visitation distribution ratio, and by employing an iterative self‑distillation procedure, our method effectively filters out suboptimal data transitions. The corrected ratio is then used to guide weighted behavior cloning, enabling the learning of a near‑optimal policy.

Our theoretical analysis guarantees that each iteration leads to a monotonic improvement in the quality of the refined dataset, and our empirical evaluations on the D4RL benchmarks, as well as on more challenging datasets with corrupted demonstrations, confirm that our approach outperforms previous state‑of‑the‑art methods in terms of both performance and stability.

Despite these advances, there are still limitations. For example, the additional iterative processing increases the training time. Moreover, if the initial state distribution during deployment significantly differs from that of the offline dataset, the learned policy might face generalization challenges. In future work, we plan to extend this framework to online settings where similar dual formulations may further enhance off‑policy learning, as well as investigate methods to improve robustness to deployment shifts.

Overall, Iterative Dual‑RL offers a promising perspective by integrating optimal discriminator weighting with iterative refinement in offline reinforcement learning. Its performance gains in challenging domains suggest that viewing offline reinforcement learning from an imitation learning perspective has significant potential.

Today, I am pleased to introduce our work on MR.Q, an approach that integrates model‐based representation learning into a model‐free deep reinforcement learning framework. In this paper, we address one of the central challenges in reinforcement learning: how to design an algorithm that is both sample efficient and computationally lightweight without sacrificing performance across a diverse set of environments. Our method, MR.Q, achieves this by learning compact state and state–action embeddings that capture essential dynamics and reward information, while enabling effective Q–value estimation. 

[Pause]

Let me begin by describing the motivation behind our work. Traditional reinforcement learning methods often fall into one of two categories. On one hand, model–free methods rely on direct estimation of value functions or policies, but they typically require enormous amounts of data or careful tuning. On the other hand, model–based approaches learn explicit models of the environment’s dynamics; while they can offer improved sample efficiency, they sometimes incur high computational overhead and may be sensitive to errors in the learned model. Our goal with MR.Q is to blend these perspectives. We use insights from model–based learning to craft a representation – an embedding of both state and action – that is nearly linear with respect to the true value function, yet we continue to update our value predictions in a model–free fashion.

In our methodology, we begin with an encoder network that processes raw observations. Depending on the input modality, this encoder can be specialized: for images, it uses multiple convolutional layers with non–linear activations; for vector–based states, a multilayer perceptron is deployed. This network produces a state embedding, denoted as zₛ. In parallel, we process the action input through a small network before combining it with zₛ to produce a state–action embedding zₛₐ. These embeddings form the backbone for the downstream value and policy networks.

[Pause]

A key theoretical insight of our work—explained through a series of theorems—is that, under proper conditions, the true value function can be expressed approximately as a linear function of the learned embedding. For example, one central formulation describes the Q–value as the dot product of zₛₐ with a weight vector w. In simpler terms, if you imagine zₛₐ as a compact summary of state and action information, then there exists a linear combination (the weight vector) which, when applied to this summary, predicts the expected cumulative reward of following the policy from that state–action pair. Our first theorem formally shows that the fixed–point solution of a semi–gradient temporal–difference update (a model–free approach) is equivalent to the solution found by our model–based rollouts, given the same underlying representation. 

When equations are presented, for instance, one key equation states that Q(s, a) is approximately equal to the inner product of zₛₐ and w. Although the formal notation is complex, you may think of it as saying “the value estimated for a state–action pair can be linearly decomposed into contributions from each feature in our embedding.” Subsequent theorems provide bounds on the error in this approximation by relating it to the accuracy of our reward and dynamics predictions. Essentially, if our model accurately encodes the immediate reward and the expected outcome of taking an action, then our overall value estimate will be correspondingly accurate.

[Pause]

Let’s now turn to the algorithm’s structure and its components. The overall network architecture of MR.Q is composed of three main parts:

1. The Encoder: This part obtains zₛ from the raw state and then produces zₛₐ by combining zₛ with a processed version of the action. One of the major benefits here is the decoupling of environment–specific details. By mapping inputs into a unified, abstract space, we are able to use the same network architecture and hyper–parameters irrespective of whether the input is a pixel observation from Atari or a vector state from a robotics simulator.
   
2. The Value Network: Using the state–action embedding zₛₐ as input, the value network outputs an estimate of the expected cumulative reward. Inspired by techniques from TD3, we actually train two separate value networks and use the minimum of their outputs to reduce over–estimation bias. In our narrative, when you hear the phrase “the target value is normalized according to the average absolute reward,” imagine that we are making our learning robust across different scales of rewards.

3. The Policy Network: This network derives actions from the state embedding zₛ. For continuous action spaces, we utilize an activation such as the hyperbolic tangent to ensure outputs lie in the correct range. For discrete actions, we use the Gumbel–Softmax function. This helps in bridging the gap between the output of the network and the environment’s action space while maintaining gradients for efficient learning.

In addition to describing the network architectures, we also discuss our loss functions. The overall loss that trains the encoder has three components:
• The Reward Loss: Rather than the traditional mean–squared error, we use a categorical cross–entropy loss. This choice is particularly effective when rewards are sparse or when their magnitude varies widely. Think of it as teaching the network to predict a “two–hot” encoding of the reward rather than a single scalar value.
• The Dynamics Loss: Here, the goal is to align the predicted next state embedding with a target embedding extracted from a target network. By doing so, the network learns a representation that reflects the true transition dynamics.
• The Terminal Loss: A simple mean–squared error is used to cater for terminal state signals, ensuring that the network correctly identifies the end of episodes.

To stabilize training, our approach employs target networks that are periodically synchronized with the main network parameters. This helps reduce non–stationarity—a frequent issue in deep reinforcement learning.

Moving on to the experimental evaluation, our paper presents extensive results on multiple benchmarks. We evaluated MR.Q across three major domains: Gym locomotion tasks, DeepMind Control Suite scenarios (with both proprioceptive and visual observations), and Atari games.

For the Gym locomotion tasks, which involve continuous control in simulated environments like Ant, Half-Cheetah, Hopper, Humanoid, and Walker2d, MR.Q demonstrated competitive performance. In many cases it approached the performance of methods like TD7 and TD-MPC2 while using a simpler architecture and fewer parameters. In these experiments, rewards were normalized relative to a baseline algorithm, ensuring that even small gains could be interpreted accurately.

[Pause]

In the DeepMind Control Suite experiments, we separated the evaluation into two parts: one with proprioceptive state inputs and another with visual inputs. When using vector observations, MR.Q achieved high rewards consistently across all 28 standard tasks. On visual inputs, our method was compared against state-of-the-art systems like DrQ–v2, DreamerV3, and TD-MPC2. Although DreamerV3 sometimes outperformed MR.Q in Atari games, it did so with a heavy model that required substantially more computational resources. Our results showed that by leveraging model–based representations within a model–free framework, MR.Q can learn fast and general representations that work across different kinds of inputs.

Beyond reporting performance metrics and learning curves, we conducted a thorough design study. In this study, we varied key design choices and hyper–parameters, such as:
• Whether the value function is linear or nonlinear.
• Which type of dynamics target we employ—using solely state embeddings versus state–action embeddings.
• The impact of reward scaling and the choice of reward loss function.
• The effect of using different horizons for multi–step returns and unrolling the dynamics.

This analysis not only helped us understand the sensitivity of MR.Q to various design decisions but also reinforced the importance of the learned representation. For instance, our study revealed that slight changes in the reward loss function can have a profound impact on performance in some benchmarks, particularly in environments with sparse rewards such as certain Atari games. These insights are valuable for anyone seeking to build general–purpose reinforcement learning algorithms.

In our discussion and conclusion, we emphasize that MR.Q represents a successful integration of model–based representation learning into a model–free reinforcement learning framework. By focusing on learning robust features that capture the underlying dynamics and reward structure of the environment, MR.Q achieves competitive performance across diverse tasks without the need for environment–specific tuning.

The implications of our work are significant. First, MR.Q demonstrates that many of the benefits of model–based learning—such as improved sample efficiency—can be captured by learning a good representation, even if planning or explicit simulation is not performed during action selection. Second, our experiments highlight the limitations imposed by relying on a single benchmark; the performance of a given algorithm can vary widely between domains. Lastly, although MR.Q does not yet address challenges like hard exploration problems or non–Markovian environments, we believe it opens up a promising path toward simpler, more versatile reinforcement learning algorithms.

Important figures and tables in our paper visually reinforce these findings. For example, one set of learning curves illustrates performance over time on the Gym locomotion tasks, showing that MR.Q reliably converges to high rewards with a narrow confidence interval. Another figure compares normalized scores across various benchmarks, highlighting that while some algorithms excel on specific tasks, MR.Q performs robustly across the board—a clear indication of its general–purpose design. Tables summarizing final performance metrics provide additional detail, such as average rewards along with 95% bootstrap confidence intervals, emphasizing the statistical reliability of our evaluations.

To summarize, our work on MR.Q brings the following key contributions:
• We propose an innovative reinforcement learning algorithm that learns an intermediary state–action representation aligned with the true value function.
• We rigorously demonstrate, both theoretically and empirically, that it is possible to combine the strengths of model–based and model–free learning.
• Our extensive experiments across state–of–the–art benchmarks show that MR.Q can achieve competitive results without requiring extensive domain–specific tuning.
• Our design study provides actionable insights into which modeling choices and hyper–parameters have the most significant influence on performance, guiding future research in deep reinforcement learning.

In closing, MR.Q offers a promising direction toward general–purpose reinforcement learning. By decoupling dynamics and reward learning from policy updates and by using robust, modular representations, we lay the groundwork for future methods that are capable of tackling ever more complex and varied tasks. We believe that continuing along this path will make advanced reinforcement learning techniques accessible to a wider scientific and engineering audience, potentially enabling applications where a one–size–fits–all approach is essential.

Thank you for your attention, and I look forward to discussing how these findings might inform and inspire your research.

Introduction and Motivation

In many real-world reinforcement learning problems, especially in safety-critical applications, the underlying constraints are not explicitly given. In our work, we address the challenge of inferring these constraints solely from expert demonstrations. Instead of having direct supervision or manually defined constraints, we develop two complementary approaches: one that uses reward correction terms and one that directly models a cost function.

The first approach, called the Inverse Reward Correction solver – or IRC solver – leverages the known reward signal and learns an additional correction term. The correction term is added to the reward so that, when combined, the modified reward makes the expert’s demonstrated behavior optimal. The second approach is known as the Inverse Constrained Reinforcement Learning solver, or ICRL solver, in which the cost function itself is inferred. This inferred cost function enforces explicit constraints through updates that directly penalize unsafe state–action pairs.

Our motivation is twofold. First, we study the training efficiency, measured as the sample complexity needed for each method to converge. Second, we conduct a detailed theoretical and empirical investigation into how well the inferred constraint signals generalize when transferred from one environment to another – what we call cross-environment transferability.

Methodology and Theoretical Analysis

We begin by defining the key building blocks. In our setting, we consider a constrained Markov decision process. The standard reward function, denoted by “r,” does not completely capture the expert’s behavior when safety constraints are present. Therefore, our IRC solver learns a reward correction term, denoted as “Delta r,” such that the corrected reward becomes r plus Delta r. In contrast, the ICRL solver learns an explicit cost function that is then combined with the reward using Lagrangian methods.

One central part of our paper is a theoretical study of training efficiency. In Section Four, we provide a formal analysis of sample complexity for both solvers. For the IRC solver, we first define the feasible set of reward correction terms by stating that for every state and action pair, if the expert assigns a nonzero probability to an action, then the corrected reward’s action-value must equal the corresponding state value. If the expert would never choose an action, then the corrected action value must not exceed the state value. In our narration, rather than stating the full mathematical inequalities, think of these conditions as ensuring that the expert’s policy remains optimal when using the modified rewards.

We derive a sample complexity upper bound for the IRC solver. In simple terms, if the solver stops at iteration K with an updated accuracy, epsilon K, then the number of samples required is on the order of four times gamma squared times the square of the maximum reward divided by the fourth power of one minus gamma times the square of epsilon K – with logarithmic factors suppressed. In plain language, this tells us that the IRC solver is relatively sample efficient, using fewer training samples than its alternative.

For the ICRL solver, the derivation is similar, except that it additionally requires estimating the reward advantage function. As a consequence, the sample complexity is larger than that of the IRC solver by a factor that is roughly one divided by the square of one minus gamma. This extra factor arises from the need to accurately capture constraint-violating moves by penalizing them through an increase in the Lagrange multiplier.

Transferability: Generalizing Safety and Optimality

In Section Five we address cross-environment transferability, which is the heart of our paper. Here we ask: when we transfer the learned constraint information – whether as Delta r or as an explicit cost function – from a source environment to a target environment with different rewards or transition dynamics, will the safety and optimality properties still be preserved?

We note that the reward correction term learned by the IRC solver captures penalties that work well in the training environment. For instance, in a hard constraint scenario, consider an example where the expert avoids a dangerous state even though the nominal reward might encourage a trajectory through that state. Through Delta r, the unsafe trajectory is penalized in the source environment. However, with a slight change in reward magnitude or dynamics for the target environment, that same penalty may be offset unexpectedly. In one illustrative example from our paper, a state is assigned a correction of negative one minus a small constant beta. In the source environment, this penalty ensures an action is chosen to avoid the unsafe state. But when the reward is increased in the target environment, the corrected rewards may inadvertently favor a trajectory that violates the safety constraint.

In contrast, the ICRL solver models constraints explicitly. Instead of a penalty that can be easily counteracted, the inferred cost function directly prohibits unsafe actions. In our theoretical treatment, we provide conditions – stated as a set of inequalities among the Q-values – which formally describe when the IRC solver fails to guarantee safety in the target environment, while the ICRL solver remains robust.

Mathematically, we introduce the concept of principal angles between subspaces, which gives a measure of similarity between the source and target dynamics. In simple terms, if the transition dynamics of the source and target environments are similar – that is, the principal angle is small – then the ICRL solver can guarantee near-optimality in the target environment under a bounded suboptimality gap quantified by epsilon. We derive inequalities that relate differences in reward functions, Lagrange multipliers, and transition dynamics terms. Although these formulas are technically involved, the key insight is that reducing the mismatch between environments improves transfer performance.

Empirical Evaluation

Our empirical study is conducted in two settings. First, we examine four different Gridworld environments. In these experiments, the agent must navigate from a blue starting point to a red target while avoiding constrained black regions. The source and target environments differ in their reward values and the probability that an action might be executed randomly. We visualize the learned constraint information as heat maps. In the Gridworld examples, the ICRL solver is shown to produce an explicit cost function that, when transferred, keeps the violation rate at zero. Meanwhile, the IRC solver initially converges quickly in the source environment. However, once its correction term is transferred to the target environment, the safety guarantee deteriorates – as seen by increasing cumulative cost in the agent’s trajectories.

The next set of experiments focuses on a continuous environment using a Blocked Half-Cheetah scenario built on the MuJoCo simulator. Here, the agent is a two-legged robot that must avoid a forbidden region defined by the X-coordinate being less than a specified threshold. In the source environment, both solvers learn constraint signals from offline demonstrations. The training curves indicate that the IRC solver has a faster pace in reaching a near-zero violation rate. Yet when the learned signals are transferred to a target environment with slightly different dynamics and scaled rewards, the IRC solver fails to guarantee safety. In contrast, the explicit cost function inferred by the ICRL solver generalizes better, with training curves showing feasible rewards remaining within safe levels and violation rates staying low.

In our figures we provided several key insights:
• One figure shows a map of a Gridworld environment with different trajectories. Here, the safe and unsafe trajectories are clearly separated by the induced costs.
• Another figure displays training curves that compare discounted cumulative rewards and costs as the iterations increase. In the source environment, both IRC and ICRL steadily improve, but in the target environment only ICRL maintains both safety and optimality.
• A final set of plots in the continuous Half-Cheetah task reveals that even though the IRC solver attains faster convergence on the source domain, its lack of robust safety transfer leads to an increase in constraint violations when applied in a new environment.

Conclusion and Future Directions

In conclusion, our work presents a comprehensive comparison between two approaches for inferring constraints in safety-critical reinforcement learning. We show theoretically and empirically that while the IRC solver is more sample efficient in training, its reliance on reward correction terms makes it less transferable to new environments. On the other hand, even though the ICRL solver requires more training samples – due in part to estimating additional advantage functions – its explicit modeling of constraints ensures that safety and optimal performance are maintained when transferring to a target environment with different reward structures or dynamics.

This study reveals a fundamental trade-off between training efficiency and generalizability in constraint inference. We also provide sufficient conditions, based on the similarity between source and target environments without complex shaping transformations, for achieving epsilon-optimality. We expect that future research may extend these methods to settings involving multiple experts, as well as to more complex real-world applications such as robotics and large-scale natural language processing systems.

Final Remarks

Our research deepens the understanding of how constraint signals can be inferred from demonstrations and then transferred across environments. We believe that these insights offer a promising step toward building reinforcement learning systems that are both safe and effective when deployed in variable, uncertain, and real-world conditions. Thank you for listening, and we hope this narration has helped clarify the intricate balance between sample efficiency and safety in inverse constraint inference.

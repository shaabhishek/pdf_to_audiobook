Introduction

In this work we address one of the most challenging problems in reinforcement learning. Offline reinforcement learning is a field in which an agent learns from pre‐collected data rather than through live interactions with the environment. This is especially useful when real-time data collection is expensive, dangerous, or simply impractical. However, a major difficulty in this setting is that the environment in which the data was collected may differ from the one in which the learned policy is ultimately deployed. This difference, or “model mismatch,” together with the fact that the dataset may be underexplored, creates significant uncertainties.

To overcome these challenges, our approach introduces what we call the double-pessimism principle. The idea is to combine two layers of caution. The first layer is a penalty for limited dataset coverage—a term that forces our algorithm to be more conservative where the data is scarce. The second layer is a penalty to address the uncertainty that comes from a mismatch between the data collection environment and the deployment environment. [pause]

The net effect is an updated Q-learning rule that calculates how good an action is in a state by not only considering the immediate reward and the estimated future value, but also subtracting two penalty terms. In plain language, the update takes the form: The new Q value becomes a weighted average of the old Q, plus a small step toward a one-step reward plus the discounted value at the next state, from which we subtract a penalty related to the model mismatch and another penalty associated with limited samples. This combination has allowed us to design a model-free algorithm that learns robust policies from offline data, even in the presence of significant environmental uncertainties. [pause]

Methodology and Key Concepts

Let us now describe our methodology. Our approach is developed for robust Markov decision processes – both in finite-horizon and infinite-horizon settings. In each case the idea is similar: we must estimate the quality of a policy in a way that accounts for worst-case uncertainty over an uncertainty set that captures possible deviations from the nominal, or data-generating, environment.

One of our key contributions is the design of the penalty function, which we denote by kappa – or “κ.” This function is computed in a model-free manner from the data. Its purpose is to provide a conservative lower bound on the worst-case value, meaning that we intentionally underestimate the expected future rewards when there is any doubt about the accuracy of our model. In our Q-learning update rule the new Q value is calculated as follows:

  • It is a convex combination of the previous estimate and a new sample.
  • The new sample is the immediate reward plus the discounted estimated value at the next state.
  • From that new sample we subtract two terms. One term is gamma times κ, which represents the penalty for model mismatch. The other term is simply a penalty, b, that depends on how many times a state-action pair has been visited in the dataset.
  • The learning rate, written as eta of n, depends on the number of times the particular state-action pair has been observed.

In plain language, think of the update as: “New Q value equals one minus eta times the old Q, plus eta multiplied by the bracket of reward plus gamma times V at the next state, minus gamma multiplied by our conservative penalty κ, and further minus an extra penalty b for dataset uncertainty.”

Mathematically, while the precise formula is a bit technical, we can say that the update enforces two principles of pessimism. One deals with the fact that if certain state-action pairs are rarely observed then the corresponding estimate should be lowered. The other deals with the fact that if our new state comes from a distribution that might suffer from a mismatch—meaning its transitions might be different from what we expect—the estimate is lowered further by κ.

A number of lemmas and theorems in our paper mathematically justify this design. For example, one key theorem shows that under the double-pessimism update, if we have enough data – roughly speaking, if the total number of samples exceeds a quantity that depends on the number of states, the planning horizon, and a constant capturing the behavior policy’s coverage – then our final policy’s robust performance will be close to that of the optimal robust policy. In one of these theoretical guarantees we demonstrate that the gap between the optimal robust value and the value of the policy produced by our algorithm is bounded by an order that is proportional to the square root of a term involving the horizon raised to the sixth power times the number of states, divided by the total number of samples. In plain terms, as the amount of data increases, the performance gap shrinks at almost the optimal rate.

For the infinite-horizon setting, we adapt the algorithm to take into account the discount factor, gamma, and we present similar sample complexity results. [pause]

An important aspect of our methodology is that it remains completely model-free. Whereas many previous approaches attempt to learn the full transition model and then solve an associated robust optimization problem, our method directly updates the Q values with only the necessary penalties. This yields a dramatic improvement in memory efficiency and scales much better to large problems. [pause]

We also discuss the design of our penalty function κ in a universal way. In one section we describe a construction applicable to a broad class of uncertainty sets that are described using distributional distances. For the special case of l-alpha-norm uncertainty sets, we provide explicit formulas. In these formulas, κ is computed by taking the uncertainty radius, R, and combining it with a minimization over a difference between a constant vector and the estimated value function, adjusted by an exponent that is the Hölder conjugate of the norm parameter. In other words, κ serves as a quantifiable “buffer” that ensures our robust estimate always stays on the conservative side.

We further showcase a case study where we adapt the construction of κ to a chi-squared divergence uncertainty set. In that case, through a constrained minimization problem – where the constraints ensure that the divergence between the perturbed transition probabilities and the nominal ones does not exceed the uncertainty radius – we arrive at a formulation for κ. This formulation again functions as an extra penalty that is computed in a data-driven and model-free manner. [pause]

Experimental Evaluation

Our algorithm was tested in two types of environments. The first set of experiments involves simulated Markov decision processes known as Garnet problems, which are randomly generated environments characterized by a given number of states, actions, and branches. In these experiments we compared the double-pessimism Q-learning algorithm with a baseline that applied only a single pessimism term. The performance metric is the “optimality gap,” which is the difference between the robust value of the optimal policy and that of the learned policy. Our figures, which may be described as line plots with shaded envelopes representing the maximum and minimum gap values over repeated runs, show that the double-pessimism algorithm converges to the true robust value much more rapidly than the baseline.

In our second set of experiments we looked at classic control problems, including environments such as MountainCar and CartPole from the OpenAI Gym. In these experiments, the underlying system parameters – such as gravity, force, or pole length – are perturbed randomly to simulate the effect of model mismatch. We trained our algorithm on data collected under the nominal settings, then evaluated the learned policies under varying levels of parameter perturbation. The reward profiles indicate that the double-pessimism algorithm consistently produces policies with higher average rewards under uncertainty compared to the single-pessimism baseline. [pause]

We also integrated our double-pessimism framework with state-of-the-art offline reinforcement learning methods based on function approximation. In one instance, we extended the approach to Conservative Q-learning, resulting in what we call double-pessimism CQL. Our experiments on the CartPole environment clearly demonstrate that, even when using deep neural network function approximators, the double-pessimism method maintains robustness to model mismatch while offering improved scalability and performance. The figures provided in the paper illustrate how the optimality gap decreases with dataset size and how robust performance, measured as average reward, remains strong even as the perturbation magnitude increases.

Mathematical Formulas and Theoretical Insights

Throughout the paper we presented multiple mathematical formulas and proofs. Although many of these formulas are complex, their roles can be summarized as follows:

• There is the central Q-learning update rule. In spoken terms, for each sample the new Q value is a blend of the old estimate and a new term. That new term consists of the received reward plus the discounted value at the next state, but then we deduct a model mismatch penalty – scaled by the discount factor – and a penalty term that accounts for statistical uncertainty in underexplored regions of the state-action space.

• We express the learning rate as a function of the number of times a particular state-action pair is visited. More visits mean the learning rate decays and the penalty term b decreases.

• Several concentration inequalities – such as Freedman’s inequality – are used to show that our empirical estimates converge to the true values with high probability. These concentration results are critical in establishing the sample complexity bounds which guarantee that our algorithm will output a robust policy provided enough data is available.

• For the finite-horizon setting, one of our key theoretical results states that if T, the total number of samples, exceeds roughly the product of the number of states and a constant related to the optimal policy’s coverage, the gap between the optimal robust value and our achieved value is on the order of the square root of (H to the sixth times S times the concentrability constant over T). For the infinite-horizon setting, similar bounds are derived that reflect the dependence on the discount factor.

In summary, the mathematical analysis supports the intuition that incorporating dual penalties – one for dataset uncertainty and one for model mismatch – allows the algorithm to be both robust and sample-efficient. [pause]

Conclusion and Implications

To summarize, our paper introduces a novel double-pessimism principle for offline reinforcement learning. By carefully penalizing overestimation due to both limited data penetration and model mismatch, our method is able to learn policies that are robust to uncertainties in the data collection environment. Our algorithm is fully model-free, which not only simplifies implementation but also significantly reduces memory requirements compared to model-based variants. This scalability makes our approach well suited for large-scale, real-world applications.

The theoretical contributions – including new sample complexity bounds and convergence guarantees – are complemented by a suite of experiments on simulated MDPs and classic control problems. In each case, the double-pessimism approach outperforms baseline methods and maintains robust performance even under severe perturbations.

The implications of this research are significant. For engineers and scientists working on systems where safe deployment is crucial – such as autonomous vehicles, robotics, or financial trading – having a method that accounts for both limited training data and potential mismatches between simulation and reality is invaluable. Our work provides a clear path towards designing reinforcement learning algorithms that are robust, scalable, and efficient. [pause]

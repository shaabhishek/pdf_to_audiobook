Introduction

In this work, we address two principal challenges in offline reinforcement learning. Offline reinforcement learning – learning policies from a fixed dataset without further environment interaction – is hampered by two key issues. First is the out-of-distribution, or OOD, problem. Second is the value alignment issue. [pause]

The OOD challenge arises because the dataset, collected from an unknown behavior policy, often under-samples regions of the state and action spaces. Consequently, value estimates on these rarely observed actions tend to be overestimated. On the other hand, behavior cloning, which mimics the behavior in the dataset using a supervised learning approach, naturally avoids the OOD problem. However, it struggles to distinguish high-quality data from poor-quality data, leading to sub-optimal policies in cases where the offline dataset is driven by mixed or non-expert behavior. [pause]

Recognizing that current offline reinforcement learning techniques often trade off between resolving the OOD challenge and achieving value alignment, our paper proposes a novel method – Value-Aligned Behavior Cloning via Bi-Level Optimization, abbreviated as V ACO. Our approach aims to simultaneously address both issues using a bi-level optimization framework. [pause]

Related Work

We build upon extensive prior work in offline reinforcement learning. Traditionally, methods like behavior cloning directly learn a supervised mapping from states to actions. This approach avoids the pitfalls of exploring outside the dataset. However, its inability to determine data quality can severely restrict performance, especially when the underlying dataset is not composed solely of expert examples. [pause]

More recent approaches have sought to combine behavior cloning with value-based methods. Some methods introduce explicit regularization terms – for example, by incorporating Kullback–Leibler divergence constraints or using regression techniques – to keep the learned policy close to the behavior policy while guiding it with value estimates. Other approaches rely on implicit regularization using generative models, such as variational autoencoders or diffusion models, to confine the policy to the latent space of the dataset. Finally, return-conditioned supervised learning methods have emerged, conditioning the policy not just on the state but also on expected future returns. [pause]

In contrast to these techniques, our work leverages meta-learning ideas alongside bi-level optimization. Rather than manually tuning regularization terms or relying on complex generative models, we introduce a meta-scoring network to assign adaptive weights to individual state-action pairs. This strategy better differentiates samples by quality and bridges the behavior cloning loss with value estimation objectives efficiently. [pause]

Methodology

Our methodology is built around two main components: Weighted Behavior Cloning and a Bi-Level Optimization Framework.

1. Weighted Behavior Cloning  
Traditionally, behavior cloning minimizes an L2 loss over all state-action pairs, treating each datum equally. However, not all samples are of equal quality. To address this, we introduce a meta-scoring network. This network takes as input a state, its associated action, and the corresponding value estimate. It then outputs an importance weight. In effect, the behavior cloning loss is transformed into a weighted summation across samples. Conceptually, more “valuable” or high-quality samples – those likely associated with better returns – receive higher weights, guiding the policy toward replicating expert behavior more closely. [pause]

For readers, think of the standard behavior cloning loss as “the average squared difference between the predicted action and the actual action.” Our adjusted loss multiplies that squared difference by a weight, ensuring that each sample’s contribution is appropriately scaled. [pause]

2. Bi-Level Optimization Framework  
We organize the training process in two nested loops. In the inner loop, we update the policy using the weighted behavior cloning loss as just described. This inner loop is responsible for policy extraction: it updates the parameters of the policy network using a standard gradient descent approach while respecting the weights learned by the meta-scoring network. [pause]

The outer loop, by contrast, focuses on value alignment. Here, the objective is to maximize the expected value of our learned policy. This is done by taking the learned policy’s actions and evaluating them with a pre-trained value network, with a small amount of controlled Gaussian noise added to encourage limited exploration. The key concept is that the outer loop tunes the meta-scoring network’s parameters so that the weighting guides the policy to achieve higher value estimates. [pause]

Mathematically, the overall optimization can be summarized as: minimize the negative value estimate subject to the constraint that the policy parameters minimize the weighted behavior cloning loss. While the inner loop uses a supervised loss – essentially, the squared error between the policy’s prediction and the observed action – the outer loop adjusts the meta-scoring network’s parameters by propagating gradients through the inner loop. This effectively aligns the policy’s behavior with the value function. For those familiar with reinforcement learning notation, imagine an inner loop that minimizes the sum over state-action pairs of the weight times the squared error, and an outer loop that maximizes the Q-value by adjusting the weight function. [pause]

Because directly differentiating through this nested optimization is challenging, we apply a “one-step differentiation” approximation. In simpler terms, we assume that the direct impact of the meta-scoring network on previous policy parameters is negligible. This assumption, commonly used in meta-learning, simplifies our computations significantly while still achieving strong empirical results. [pause]

An overview of our algorithm is as follows:  
• First, there is an initial phase of value network training using temporal difference learning. This phase effectively pre-trains our value function on the offline dataset.  
• Following that, in the bi-level optimization phase, we alternate between updating the policy in the inner loop and adjusting the meta-scoring network in the outer loop.  
• The inner loop employs a standard gradient descent step on the weighted behavior cloning loss, while the outer loop updates the meta-scoring network parameters based on the gradient of the value function with respect to the policy parameters. [pause]

This bi-level structure offers an elegant mechanism to balance the out-of-distribution challenge with value alignment concerns simultaneously, all while maintaining computational efficiency. [pause]

Experimental Evaluation

We conducted comprehensive experiments using the D4RL benchmark, which includes a variety of environments such as Gym MuJoCo tasks and the AntMaze domain. [pause]

In the MuJoCo domain, we evaluated our method on standard continuous control tasks – Half-Cheetah, Hopper, and Walker2d – using datasets of varying quality. These include “medium,” “medium-replay,” “medium-expert,” and “expert” datasets. Baseline comparisons cover classic methods such as behavior cloning and TD3, as well as modern approaches that incorporate explicit regularization, implicit regularization, and return-conditioned supervised learning. [pause]

Table summaries in the paper report normalized scores, with a value of 100 representing expert-level performance. Our method, V ACO, consistently outperformed a range of baselines across different environments and dataset qualities. For instance, in many MuJoCo tasks, V ACO achieved significantly higher average scores, indicating both stable performance across lower-quality and sub-optimal datasets and superior performance on expert datasets. [pause]

In the AntMaze experiments, which assess an algorithm’s ability to "stitch" together trajectories over long horizons, V ACO demonstrated strong performance. Here, traditional methods sometimes suffered large performance drops – especially when facing large-scale maze tasks – but V ACO maintained competitive scores and robust trajectory stitching. [pause]

We also studied the effectiveness of our meta-scoring network in assigning weights. We compared our learned weights against two heuristic strategies: one that used the reciprocal of the value estimate and another based on advantage-weighted regression. Although the heuristic methods provided some improvements over plain behavior cloning, they fell short compared to the adaptive, learned weighting employed by V ACO. [pause]

Further, through ablation studies, we demonstrated the importance of the different inputs to the meta-scoring network. Removing either the value input or the state information resulted in a marked drop in performance, particularly on medium and medium-replay datasets. Additionally, we found that gradually reducing the amount of noise added in the outer loop – which encourages limited exploration early during training – further improved the algorithm’s performance. [pause]

Additional Analyses and Visualizations

The paper includes several insightful figures and tables that help to visualize the performance and behavior of V ACO. For example: [pause]

• One figure illustrates a schematic diagram of the two core challenges in offline reinforcement learning: the overestimation of values in out-of-distribution regions and sub-optimal policy extraction within the in-sample domain. This visual helps motivate why balancing behavior cloning and value estimation is critical. [pause]

• Another key figure shows the learning curves for both the inner and outer loops during training. The inner loop's weighted actor loss decreases steadily, while the outer loop’s value maximization curve rises and then stabilizes, demonstrating that both components evolve in a complementary manner. [pause]

• We also examined the relationship between the learned meta weights and the Q-values estimated by our value network. Although the Pearson correlation between individual meta weights and Q-values was only weakly positive, further analysis at the trajectory level revealed a strong positive correlation between the average meta weights and the total trajectory rewards. In essence, higher meta weights were predominantly assigned to state-action pairs generated by expert or near-expert policies. [pause]

• A toy example was also included. In this simplified setting, a ball is projected with a given initial speed and varying initial heights and projection angles. By comparing the action outputs from vanilla behavior cloning, a method like implicit Q-learning, and our V ACO method at a fixed state, we showed that V ACO produced action outputs that better aligned with the best estimated outcomes. [pause]

Conclusion and Discussion

In summary, the V ACO framework integrates weighted behavior cloning and value estimation through a bi-level optimization strategy to address the dual challenges of out-of-distribution errors and value misalignment in offline reinforcement learning. [pause]

Our experiments on diverse continuous control tasks demonstrate that the V ACO method consistently achieves state-of-the-art performance across multiple benchmarks. The meta-scoring network, which learns to assign importance to each training sample, plays a crucial role. It ensures that the policy not only closely imitates the expert-like behaviors found in the dataset but also aligns well with the value function, thereby maximizing the expected return. [pause]

In addition to improved performance, our framework also offers significant advantages in training efficiency. For instance, the meta-scoring network is active only during the training phase and can be turned off during inference. This design choice retains fast inference speeds while ensuring that the policy network receives robust guidance during learning. [pause]

It is also worth noting that our work paves the way for future research. While our results are promising, one interesting avenue is to explore relaxing some of the simplifying assumptions used in our bi-level optimization – particularly the “one-step differentiation” assumption – to see if even more accurate gradients can further boost performance without incurring prohibitive computational costs.
